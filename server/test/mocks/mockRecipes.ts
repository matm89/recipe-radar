export const recipeHistory =  `While "Green Tomato Salad" is a broad term, the use of green tomatoes in salads and relishes has deep roots in North American culinary traditions, particularly in the Southern United States. Before tomatoes fully ripened on the vine, particularly in cooler climates or at the end of the growing season, they were often preserved or incorporated into dishes. This practice became especially prominent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, where pickling and frying green tomatoes were common methods of using them.

The concept of a "salad" using green tomatoes likely evolved from these preservation techniques, where thinly sliced or chopped green tomatoes could be combined with other readily available ingredients like onions, peppers, and a vinegar-based dressing. This allowed for their tartness and firm texture to be enjoyed in a fresh or slightly preserved state. The specific composition of a "Green Tomato Salad" can vary greatly by region and family tradition, reflecting the adaptable nature of this type of dish.`
